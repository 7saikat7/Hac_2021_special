                <p>Crystal clear seas, powdery white sand and indulgence beyond measure are three things 
                    that come to mind whenever the Maldives is mentioned.
                     Whilst the country is famous for its unique beauty and extravagant resorts, it is not solely dedicated 
                     to the wealthy tourist – it offers various accommodation options catering to a diverse range of preferences.
                     These facilities are broadly categorized into four types: resorts, hotels, guesthouses and liveaboards.

                <p>Ever since the relaxation of tourism rules which were restricting all tourism to resorts on uninhabited islands, 
                    the guesthouse industry has boomed  in Maldives. Since then, many guesthouses have been developed 
                    in inhabited islands, with the greater Male’ region being the main hub.

                <p>For reasons such as their elegance, the Maldives are known as “the tropical paradise.”
                     This tropical country is divided into islands, each of which is surrounded by its lagoon. 
                     Pure white sand beaches can be found on each island.
